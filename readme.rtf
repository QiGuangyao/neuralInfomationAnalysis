Neural information was measured by the percentage of explained variance, PEV.
Task variables relationship was measured by fractional variable variance, FVV.
The shared variance between different subspaces captured by principal component analysis (PCA) was measured by cross-project variance by each PCs.
The following work inspired these analyses:
